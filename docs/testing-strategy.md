# ServiceBridge Platform Testing Strategy

## User Data Isolation Testing

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for ensuring proper user data isolation in the ServiceBridge platform. The goal is to verify that users can only access resources they own or have been explicitly granted access to.

### Testing Objectives

1. Verify that users can only access their own projects
2. Verify that users can only access tasks within projects they have access to
3. Verify that team-based access controls work correctly
4. Verify that task assignment permissions work as expected
5. Ensure proper error responses (403 Forbidden) when unauthorized access is attempted

### Test Scripts

We have developed several specialized test scripts to verify different aspects of user data isolation:

#### 1. Basic User Isolation Test (`scripts/test-user-isolation.js`)

This script tests the fundamental user isolation principle by:
- Creating two different user accounts
- Having each user create their own project
- Verifying that each user can access their own project
- Verifying that each user cannot access the other user's project

Expected results:
- User 1 can access User 1's project (200 OK)
- User 2 can access User 2's project (200 OK)
- User 1 cannot access User 2's project (403 Forbidden)
- User 2 cannot access User 1's project (403 Forbidden)

#### 2. Team Access Test (`scripts/test-team-access.js`)

This script tests team-based access controls by:
- Creating multiple user accounts
- Creating teams with different members
- Creating projects associated with teams
- Testing access based on team membership

Expected results:
- Team owners can manage team membership
- Team members can access projects associated with their teams
- Non-team members cannot access team projects
- Users can access projects from all teams they belong to

#### 3. Task Assignment Test (`scripts/test-task-assignment.js`)

This script tests task-level permissions by:
- Creating different user roles (creator, assignee, unrelated)
- Creating tasks with specific assignments
- Testing access and modification permissions for each role

Expected results:
- Task creators can view, modify, and delete their tasks
- Task assignees can view and update assigned tasks, but not delete them
- Unrelated users cannot view, modify, or delete tasks they don't own or aren't assigned to

### Running the Tests

To run these tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Basic user isolation test
node scripts/test-user-isolation.js

# Team access test
node scripts/test-team-access.js

# Task assignment test
node scripts/test-task-assignment.js
```

### Interpreting Test Results

Each test script provides clear console output with:
- ✅ PASS indicators for successful test cases
- ❌ FAIL indicators for failed test cases
- Detailed error messages when tests fail

A successful test run should show all test cases passing, confirming that the user data isolation implementation is working correctly.

### Continuous Testing Strategy

To ensure ongoing data isolation integrity:

1. **Regression Testing**: Run these tests after any changes to authentication, authorization, or resource access logic.

2. **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically verify data isolation with each build.

3. **Expanding Test Coverage**: Continuously add new test cases as new features are developed that involve user data access.

4. **Security Auditing**: Periodically review and update tests to cover potential new security vulnerabilities or edge cases.

## API Endpoint Testing Matrix

| Endpoint | Owner Access | Team Member Access | Assignee Access | Unrelated User Access |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| GET /projects/:id | ✅ | ✅ (if team member) | ❌ | ❌ |
| PUT /projects/:id | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| DELETE /projects/:id | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| GET /projects/:id/tasks | ✅ | ✅ (if team member) | ❌ | ❌ |
| POST /projects/:id/tasks | ✅ | ✅ (if team member) | ❌ | ❌ |
| GET /projects/:id/tasks/:taskId | ✅ | ✅ (if team member) | ✅ (if assignee) | ❌ |
| PUT /projects/:id/tasks/:taskId | ✅ | ✅ (if team member) | ✅ (if assignee) | ❌ |
| DELETE /projects/:id/tasks/:taskId | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Future Testing Enhancements

1. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance impact of access control checks on API response times.

2. **Stress Testing**: Verify that access controls remain effective under high load conditions.

3. **Penetration Testing**: Attempt to bypass access controls through various attack vectors.

4. **Frontend Integration Testing**: Ensure the frontend correctly handles authorization errors and prevents unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: As the platform evolves to support multiple organizations, expand testing to verify isolation between tenant data.
